[0:13:48] <cantdonateimbroke> Doublelift isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability and movement with Vayne? Doublelift puts the game on another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. Faker breaks records. Sneaky breaks records. Doublelift breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic. And his haircut.

[0:25:17] <%howlingpantera> but yes mages are meta too

[0:28:24] <Seanemone> @Free_Palesteemo but if they were equal strength teams like TL probably wouldnt even give it the effort, theyd just play ADC's since that's what their so proficient at and what DL is comfortable on.

The sheer knowledge that at least one other person will notice your masterpiece, highlight it, and copypasta. This is my safe place. This is where I will plant my pastas to grow up to be big pasta trees.

[2:35:40] <+Plz_Stahp> @Tesverhof personal experience, facts, logic, opinions of multiple pros, etc.
[2:35:41] <Laughingracoon89> @Plz_Stahp That I can somewhat agree with, but it's mainly that mr items in general are just bad. If there were better mr items then the mages that are strong right now wouldnt be as a strong.

[2:39:52] <Laughingracoon89> @Plz_Stahp The only reason mr pen being that low is super efficient is because mr as a stat is really low and mr items suck. Lethality is actually cheaper but because there's more armour in the game than mr it's not as efficient. And also because of the fact that you dont get the full effect of lethality initially.

[2:41:34] <Laughingracoon89> @Plz_Stahp lost chapter I agree though is pretty op, the amount of mana sustain you have is too high. It should either cost more or give less mana. Double pen being not too expensive would be fine but mr is too low as a stat and also mr items like I said suck. You're not gonna stack mr to not die to a akali but if they have talon or qiyana you're gonna get zhonyas or ga tabi or something. Another problem is health is basically the counter.

[2:47:36] <Zivs> dossoerf xayah ult is rarely used for damage
[2:47:38] <Seanemone> And if they do they’re trolling
[2:47:38] <Syst3mf3hler> have u seen that rekless is spamming mages?
[2:47:39] <Ionwe_jorn> Love yuou @Doublelift
[2:47:39] <PepegaDetective_C134> @emnebs yes

[2:47:45] <sad__optimist> @ottonormalverbraucher77 that doesn't mean he should be
[2:47:47] <+notsnaps> @dossoerf depends, usually basic combo
[2:47:47] <loweloyasu0> @Doublelift do you think that fpx or grf will be better this worlds?
[2:47:47] <%nitrocat> @Doublelift can you say anything funny happened during scrimms or will that leaked funny info ruin something?

[2:48:07] <+DocoRock> the gar is Nar
[2:48:08] <Synatic72> @Doublelift do you think its a downside of esports that preparing for a tournament means practicing against the teams before the tournament already? In classical sports you dont have that rly
[2:48:11] <Judgh> what the hell is a performance enhancing drug in esports? ritalin?
[2:48:11] <panluffy123> and fun 4sure :)

[2:48:57] <tommyknox99> Botlane picks seem crazy now so many diff things
[2:48:58] <poosi> u should ask for tips from crs veigar
[2:48:59] <erkan_0713> Türkler burdamisiniz
[2:48:59] <HelixAura> can you play varus?
[2:49:00] <gzhz_> dxplicit its because of perkz
[2:49:02] <+ereboselter7> what does 3p5p bot mean
[2:49:03] <%daklaw> @Doublelift no syndra practice?
[2:49:03] <rhetrospect> play Ashe
[2:49:04] <+notsnaps> @dossoerf again depends, usually its more worth to save ult for self-peel

[2:49:19] <%3b00d_09> @ereboselter7 means third pick and fifth pick are duo
[2:49:20] <SumoPotato> 3p5p?

[5:34:05] <+Plz_Stahp> @qeni__ if he plays it better he can do more damage with trinity especially with Yuumi and the cdr he has, BT is mostly bad on Ez and it's better to go Bork + Merc for life steal, and him getting one shot there was because he didn't as well as he could have, and prob didn't expect to get one shot but he prob gets oneshot there even with iceborn so ur logic seems flawed
