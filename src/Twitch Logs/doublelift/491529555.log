[1:29:54] <+Thejim22> @billybobbins123 my argument is that on paper she does what the ADC role does and gets additional utility. Bot laners hit 6 before herald and 11 before Barren, so the slightly lower xp growth doesn't affect her power spikes during key game moments. So why not treat her as a flex in draft and open up more options? Unless there's a weakness I'm not considering.
