I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

[2:38:44] <+max_power1> Pasta (US: /Ààp…ëÀêst…ô/, UK: /Ààp√¶st…ô/; Italian pronunciation: [Ààpasta]) is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour (semolina) mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture

After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problem sleeping.

[2:41:28] <+max_power1> Pasta (US: /Ààp…ëÀêst…ô/, UK: /Ààp√¶st…ô/; Italian pronunciation: [Ààpasta]) is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour (semolina) mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture

I‚Äôm a boy that‚Äôs why I was saying roleplay.. this isn‚Äôt a troll. again, I know it‚Äôs really random and weird. I‚Äôm sorry.
