[0:15:22] <bustershkrtwitch> @VaedeLive rakan can sheild cc and do dmg and build tank or just full support items, plus xayay just makes his e better plus a just all around safe kit fo them both but still very aggresive, and the thing that makes them rly great is they have 70 combos together and there rly is no "good" counter

[3:25:31] <SageSamo> @jamessaysdance THANKS <3
[3:25:33] <+Jinryuki> DamWon has a very solid bot lane. They are one of the best rookie bot lanes to play the game. Sometimes they tunnel too much, but that is because this is their first year and they are too eager. But if you don't shut them down they carry. If they go even they carry late very hard.

[3:28:10] <+Jinryuki> You don't understand. This patch is not about winning bot lane. It's who can hold bot the best while taking dragons. This is a 25-30 min Tourney not a scale tourney. Your bot needs to be effective mid game team fights and DWG does that very well. All of the LCK teams practiced mid game like crazy. And all of them have bot lanes that are resource free lanes.
