I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of arm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed,I usually have no problem sleeping .

[1:06:02] <doublelifts_meat> The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over

[1:13:36] <I_Am_A_Nervous_Potato> The year is 2019. Team Liquid has just made history by reaching the championship match of worlds. Their opponents: Cloud9 Gaming. The match is grueling and close, coming down to one final fight in the fifth game of the series. Doublelift's Lucian pops the GA of Svenskeren's Lee Sin on the edge of the teamfight. As he waits for the revive to finish, he realizes that everyone else is dead and the entire game - nay, his entire life up to this point - hinges on this one moment. Does he cast Heal?

[2:24:46] <Metropoliman> I like long messages. I feel like they're so powerful. I feel like the reason it gets so much attention is the diversity element behind it. When one sees a long message among many short messages, their focus will be averted from the autopilot state. I also feel like potatoes are really good because of its flexibility. You can make it mashed, boiled, sweet, baked and it goes with almost everything.
