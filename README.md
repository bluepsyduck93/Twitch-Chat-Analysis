# Twitch-Chat-Analysis

## Background:

For my final semester at Rutgers University, I decided to take a pilot class in Natural Language Processing 
and make my final semester project on trying to analyze something that is interesting and novel. Twitch chat was 
the first thing that came up in my head at the time because of it is known to the community as something that is
very chaotic.

I hope you come to enjoy this project as much as I do.
